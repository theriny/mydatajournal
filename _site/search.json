    "text": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Therin!\nIâ€™m a data scientist passionate about building tools that make data more accessible and actionable. I earned my masterâ€™s in mechanical engineering from Iowa State University in 2016, and Iâ€™m currently a PhD candidate using machine learning and 3D modeling to build software solutions for precision agriculture applications. I use Python, Azure, and SQL in my current role.\nI spent 2 years at Ford Motor Company as a data scientist on the Material Cost & Analytics team where I used Python, Qlik, and Alteryx to build analytics dashboards and forecasting tools to optimize vehicle feature scheduling and reduce revenue loss. I also spent a year with Collaborative Real Estate gathering insight from FLASH parking data to improve the parker experience.\nWhen Iâ€™m not out playing soccer with my two boys or spending time with my wife, Iâ€™m producing beats on my Maschine, playing bass guitar, or getting owned by teenagers in Fortnite.\nYou can find some of my work on my Github.\nHereâ€™s a quick animation of how I use 3D modeling and Python to automate the extraction of features (phenotypes) from soybean canopies. https://www.collabre.co/\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
